# Software Workshop
Everything Dan talked about at the software workshop on January 3rd, 2017.

**Before all else, note that the 2017 Control System documentation is live [right here][1].**


### Installing Eclipse and FIRST WPI Tools
First, let's get going with Eclipse and install the tools, then we will jump into some basic Java.

To install Eclipse, visit [this link][2] and download the correct *Eclipse* version for your Operating System - most likely it will already know and you'll just have to hit **Download**.

To use *Eclipse* and Java, you will need to have Java installed on your computer. Either follow the WPI steps [here][3], or go directly to [the Java SDK download][4] and select the Java SDK download (NOT WITH NETBEANS).

Follow [the WPI steps][3] to finish installing the **FIRST WPI Java tools** and to get your environment up and running.

*Note: The link for the WPI tools are located at 'http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/release/eclipse/'*

We will do all of our work in Eclipse, including writing the code, testing the code, and deploying it to the *RoboRio*. You should create a new project and mess around with *Eclipse* and Java, especially if you are new to the environment or the programming language.

### Install Git and Using it
I highly suggest using a Windows computer, since that's the only environment that all of the *FIRST* tools and code works well on. To install *git* on your computer, visit [https://git-scm.com/download/win][5] for the download package, and run it. We will need to **clone** our [prototype project][6] to our computers so that we can keep building and working on it. It will become our 2017 robot.

For info on *Git* and *GitHub* please see [my tutorial][7].
